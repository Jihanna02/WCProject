				<blockquote>
					&#34;I&#8242;m not going to present you with a fairy-tale image of Gotham. It&#8242;s a hard luck town. It always has been. It&#8242;s a place of dark tragedies and bitter ironies. A city of deep shadows and sharp contrasts. A city that touches everyone who lives there. For good and bad. I see Gotham as an anvil. One is broken or tempered on it. So many trials. So much misfortune. So little hope. But some thrive there. Gothamites are a tough breed. They&#8242;re proud of their town and their talent for living in it. My family has lived there for two centuries. It was there that they built the financial giant that is a leading player in a half dozen industries. And it was Gothamites who helped build it. By their sweat and their labor and sometimes their lives they made Gotham a world competitor. Against all the odds. Maybe Gotham is inspiring in its own way. Inspiration spurred by fear. Or something even darker. But despite their troubles and their setbacks, Gothamites keep going. And there&#8242;s something noble about that. It&#8242;s an admirable trait, I think. Every city has its own personality. I like to think that dogged determination is Gotham&#8242;s. It&#8242;s a town that&#8242;s never had its hand out. That&#8242;s never played the victim. It&#8242;s a town that&#8242;s used to standing alone. It bears being maligned and forgotten. It helps itself.&#34;

							Wayne Enterprises (formerly <strong>WayneCorp</strong>) is a company in the DC Universe. Wayne Enterprises is owned by billionaire <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_(Bruce_Wayne)">Bruce Wayne</a> and run by his business manager <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lucius_Fox_(New_Earth)">Lucius Fox</a>. It was founded by merchant ancestors of the Wayne family in the 17th century as a merchant house. It changed and gradually grew when it was officially erected in the 19th century when Alan Wayne, heir to Solomon Wayne, founded Wayne Shipping and Wayne Chemical. Along with Wayne Manufacturing, which came later, the Industrial Revolution fueled Wayne Enterprises into becoming a major powerhouse. In addition to providing an income for Bruce Wayne, the various activities of the organization help facilitate his Batman activities New York city location.

					<div class="history">
						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>
						Descending from "Mad" Anthony Wayne and his brother, Darius Wayne (a hero of the American Revolution), carles Arwin Wayne managed the Wayne Family&#8242;s then-modest fortune by buying cheap property and holding on to it as Gotham Town grew. As a result, upon his death at age fifty-two, Charles left a considerable real-estate fortune in the form of a merchant house which he left to his sons Solomon Zebediah Wayne and Joshua Thomas Wayne; both of whom became prominent citizens of <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Gotham_Town">Gotham Town</a> in the late 1850s.
						Soloman&#8242;s son of his second wife, Alan Wayne, would marry Catherine Van Derm; a member of the once-wealthy Van Derm family, and together they would have a son named Kenneth Wayne. With Alan spearheading the growth and development of the Gotham Railroads and creating <strong>Wayne Shipping</strong>, & <strong>Wayne Chemicals</strong>, and later <strong>Wayne Manufacturing</strong>, which took great advantage of the Industrial Revolution, Wayne Enterprises became a powerhouse. Kenneth&#8242;s son, Patrick Morgan Wayne, saw the Wayne legacy through two world wars and built <strong>WayneCorp</strong> out of the ashes of the Great Depression and later developed <strong>WayneTech</strong>, whose aircraft plants and shipworks fueled American efforts in the Pacific War. His wife, Laura Elizabeth Wayne, inherited the Wayne fortune at age thirty-seven and became the first Wayne to direct the conglomerate toward ecological responsibility.
						Patrick and Laura&#8242;s son, Thomas Wayne, as a doctor and philanthropist, would create and contribute the <strong>Wayne Foundation</strong> and its various divisions to the conglomerate. While his son, Bruce Wayne, would expand the conglomerate&#8242;s focus to become a global powerhouse in a wide variety of fields, this diversity allowed him to use the conglomerate&#8242;s resources for the better-ment of mankind by financing and providing resources for not only his own endeavours, but for the financing of various hero groups such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Justice">Young Justice</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans">Teen Titans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsiders_(comics)">Outsiders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_Prey_(comics)">Birds of Prey</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League">Justice League</a>, as well as combating poverty and disaster-affected areas.
						<strong>Wayne Enterprises</strong> is perhaps the only Gotham-based corporation to weather the city&#8242;s earthquake and year of No Man&#8242;s Land. The company ensured its continued survival by transferring the burden of its manufacturing to satellite facilities elswhere. After fierce debate, the American congress reneged the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Land_(comics)">No Man&#8242;s Land</a> and the ambitious "Billion Dollar Build-Up" Federal Works Project began, teaming <strong>LexCorp</strong>, <strong>STAR Labs</strong>, <strong>Wayne Enterprises</strong>, <strong>Wayne Foundation</strong> and the <strong>US Army Corps of Engineers</strong> in rebuilding Gotham from the ground up.
						Profits earned by Wayne Enterprises during NML were some for the first capital funds applied to the city&#8242;s eventual rebuilding. Without hesitation, Wayne Enterprises exceeded Lex Luthor&#8242;s investments in Gotham&#8242;s future.

					<h3>Batman, Incorporated</h3>
					<p>
						Recently, CEO Bruce Wayne made headlines when he announced that he would begin officially funding the vigilante known as the Batman in a &#8220;new era in the fight against crime&#8221; through the formation of a subsidiary called <em>Batman, Incorporated</em>. Wayne&#39;s interest in the Batman likely stems from his own experience with violent crime as a child, but several investors have questioned whether Waynee&#39;s noted incompetence in the boardroom will actually provide a benefit to the Batman, rather than a hindrance.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div id="aerospace" class="hide"> 
					<h3>Wayne Aerospace</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Wayne Aerospace</em> is a subsidiary of <strong>Wayne Technologies</strong> and remains one of the more highly successful divisions of Wayne Enterprises. It has its own airline called <strong>Wayne Airlines</strong> and an aviation division called <strong>Wayne Aviation</strong>. The aerospace division is a major military defense contractor within Gotham and the United States. The W.A. is mostly known for its extremely well structured, luxurious and exclusive corporate and private jets and airliners. Much like the Gulfstream, Wayne Enterprises tries to keep the Slipstream corporate jets out of the hands of celebrities and sells them mostly to large corporations. This in turn has made the Slipstream into a cult item among the rich because it is fashionable to have a plane as a status symbol of wealth. Wayne Aerospace&#8242;s experimental aviation branch produces experimental and the research planes built for the United States government and NASA. The military aviation branch designs and manufactures highly successful jet fighters and helicopters for the American Air Forces. The most notable models of these are the W-4 Wraith fighter and the Kestrel attack helicopter. As the most prominent aerospace company in the region, Wayne Aerospace has a working partnership with Eagle Air Force Base near Gotham City. Wayne Aerospace is also responsible for maintaining the systems and the planes for the Archie Goodwin International Airport in Little Stockton, in Gotham. Wayne Aerospace maintains good natured competition with other aerospace corporations like <strong>Ferris Air</strong> and its nemesis, <strong>LexAir</strong>. The division has generated millions of dollars for Wayne Enterprises. The company&#8242;s government contracts and space exploration contracts with NASA have been very lucrative. However, Wayne Aerospace&#8242;s most important mission is to provide the latest technology and information for the Dark Knight to vanquish crime and his enemies.

				<div id="technologies" class="hide"> 
					<h3>Wayne Technologies</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Wayne Technologies</em> is the biggest division within Wayne Enterprises. As more and more innovations were made and new things were discovered, the division has played an important role in the technology scene around Gotham -  providing the latest and cutting edge devices for Batman. As alien invasions and involvement have become more sporadic around Gotham, <strong>WayneTech</strong> acquired alien technology and used it for research and development. With this breakthrough acquisition, <strong>Wayne Enterprise</strong> was able to rival technologies produced by its nemesis, <strong>LexCorp</strong>. Some of Wayne Technologies&#8242; research into alien technology has contributed to large breakthroughs in medicine, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals and avionics. Subsidiaries of <strong>WayneTech</strong> include: <strong>Holt Holdings Inc.</strong> (the company formerly owned by the current <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Holt_(New_Earth)">Mister Terrific</a>), <strong>Wayne Biotech</strong>, <strong>Wayne Pharmaceuticals</strong>, and <strong>Wayne Healthcare</strong>. <strong>WayneTech</strong> is a great resource for Batman. Not only does it provide contacts for him into the high technology world, the division can also be used to analyze whatever gadget he might find faster than he would be able to do alone. <strong>WayneTech</strong> also provides a source of business income for <strong>Wayne Enterprises</strong> as the company owns dozens of patents, including all of Holt&#8242;s systems except the T-Spheres, as licensing these patents can be extremely lucrative for the company. With the strength of this division, Batman has access to any kind of medical facility or procedure, from normal to special or experimental applications, information and medical analysis. Through the company he also has access to medical files on everyone in Gotham. Since <strong>WayneTech</strong> is the market leader in cybernetic applications, he has extremely high level government contracts and contacts.

				<div id="foods" class="hide"> 
					<h3>Wayne Foods</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Wayne Foods</em> is a little known subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises with its headquarters based in downtown Gotham City. The firm was started in 1872 by an Irish immigrant, Patrick Toole, under the name, <strong>Toole &amp; Sons Food Merchants</strong>. It runs a number of farms and cattle ranches in the Breadbasket regions of the United States, and business was successful in importing Irish products that could be sold at a higher cost in the US economy. By 1905, there were five Toole &amp; Sons stores throughout Gotham City. Patrick Toole died at the age of 72 in 1919, leaving the business to his eldest son, Thomas Toole. Thomas was keen on expanding business across the US; however, the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 severely impacted trade lines from Ireland to Gotham. At the end of the war in 1918, Toole &amp; Sons Food Merchants was near bankruptcy. Thomas, unable to carry on his father’s legacy, committed suicide in 1922 at age 43. The second youngest Toole brother, Rory, took over the business and immediately set about selling all company assets in favor of entering liquidation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The business was bought in 1925 by the Wayne family, who were keen on preserving an important part of Gotham’s retail history. It is one of the most financially successful divisions at Wayne Enterprises and oldest branches. The business returned to profit in less than a year, and by the end of the second World War, Toole &amp; Sons stores controlled over 60% of all food retail across the city. This was achieved by diversifying the product range and opening up stock to new markets outside of Ireland and within the US. The company changed its name to Wayne Foods in 1956. Today, Wayne Foods focuses on the high end market and specialty goods. Although it no longer has the dominance across Gotham as it did from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, Wayne Foods continues to generate significant revenue for Wayne Enterprises. Wayne Foods produces specialized products like ecological foods, natural lines with no additives and controlled growing. Wayne Foods remains a source of information and contacts for Batman, helping to keep tabs on the food product market and threats pertaining to the safety of the food supply around Gotham City.

The former PAAL CEO, Andreas Milanic, successfully floated Wayne Shipping on the New York Stock Exchange in 1988. The Wayne Family currently owns 57% of the company, with Milanic&#8242;s second son, Dragoslav, owning 20% (and the remaining 23% is in public ownership). Despite a lack of investment in Wayne Shipping since the merger took place, the company still remains an important player in world ocean transportation.

As the government&#8242;s own naval shipyards started to pull out from Gotham, Wayne Steel moved in and acquired them for <strong>WayneYards</strong>. The division of the company has always maintained a great working relationship with Gotham-based shipyards. Due to the high quality of their steel, Wayne Steel has also supplied shipyards outside of Gotham with their steel needs. Recent globe-spanning events have left the US navy depleted of ships and the U.S. government since been its most prominent customer for the division, as Wayne Steel has run into a boom and at times can&#8242;t supply enough steel to the industry. Because of this, Wayne Steel has started to open more steel mills close to Gotham and also around the United States. This has a lead to a major windfall profits for the company. Metallurgical studies have become extremely crucial as alien technologies and new alloys have been studied and then replicated. A new side of the business that has only recently started to take off has positioned Wayne Steel it has had with the government from the 19th century, the division of the company has become a market leader in the study of alien alloys from recent economic and manufacturing crises. This division of Wayne Enterprises allows Batman to prioritize technology and alloys for him to study. Wayne Steel&#8242;s alliance with the US Navy and the government has produced numerous contacts for Wayne Steel.
